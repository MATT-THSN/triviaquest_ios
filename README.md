# Trivia Quest App

## What is a Trivia Quest App?

Trivia quest is a simple animal trivia application. This is iOS application I developed following the iOS Developer Career Path on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).  My main motivation for building this application was to practice my core Swift skills and to develop a fundamental working knowledge of SwiftUI.  I learnt a lot developing this app, learning about the [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model–view–viewmodel) architectural methodology was very insightful and hopefully set me up to build even better iOS applications in the future.

### Features
- An app comprising a welcome screen, question screen and results screen.
- The ability to add or remove questions at will without needing to adjust the U.I.
- Score tracking and feedback indictors to show the user when they've selected either the correct or wrong answer.

### How to run the app

Download the package files and open them in Xcode.  Use the iOS simulator to run the app.

### Techologies
- Swift
    > Swift is a robust and intuitive programming language created by Apple for building apps for iOS, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. It’s designed to give developers more freedom than ever. Swift is easy to use and open source, so anyone with an idea can create something incredible.
- SwiftUI
    > SwiftUI helps you build great-looking apps across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift — and surprisingly little code. You can bring even better experiences to everyone, on any Apple device, using just one set of tools and APIs.
